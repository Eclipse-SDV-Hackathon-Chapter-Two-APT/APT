## Project Overview

Nowadays, we are exposed to various dangers on the road regardless of place or time. For example, a collision between vehicles in a city center can cause serious traffic disruption, and bad weather creates the worst possible situation for inattentive drivers. These traffic problems can have negative effects not only on the people involved, but also on other drivers.
Therefore, we would like to propose a service that can protect surrounding vehicles from potential threats. We also propose a comprehensive traffic accident prevention system that guides the police to respond quickly to accidents and prevent secondary damage.
